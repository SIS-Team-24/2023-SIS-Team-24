text = """In the mystical village of Eldertown, young Elara discovered a magical, whispering stone. The ancient, translucent crystal glowed gently, holding within it the wisdom and tales of yore. With each whisper, it dispelled sadness and showered abundant joy upon the enchanted hamlet. One ominous night, shadows attempted to engulf Eldertown, erasing its light and cheer. Elara, holding the magical stone aloft, whispered back stories of hope and valor. The shadows recoiled, defeated by the radiant energy emanating from the tales. Dawn broke, with Eldertown basking in renewed glory, and Elaraâ€™s whispering stone continuing its silent, eternal storytelling."""
